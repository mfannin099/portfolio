            <h3>My Reading Tendencies</h3>
            <p> I decided to try something new and picked a book up to read for fun two summers ago (2018). I ended up really enjoying it and soon found out
               it was a passion of mine. My favorite types of books are ones where I can learn something, with a goal to read a chapter everyday. My favorite
               subjects consist of: Psychology, Business, and Motivational.
